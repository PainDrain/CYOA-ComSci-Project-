    <p> You all decided to help the peasants! You snuck up on the shoulders and attacked them, helping the peasants get weapons and fend off the knights.</p>
    
    <p> Thanks to all of your efforts, the knights fled back to the castle!</p>
    
    <p> You and the peasants team up! You and the ninjas are now deciding whether or not you should train the peasants before going to the king, although this gives the knights the chance to prepare too...</p>
